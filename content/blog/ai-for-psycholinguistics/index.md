Recently, I participated in the organization of a Chinese [workshop](https://ai-for-psycholinguistics.readthedocs.io/zh-cn/latest/intro.html) about NLP at Chinese Psycholinguistic Society in Guangzhou in 2023 (with [Prof. Nai Ding](https://person.zju.edu.cn/dingnai), [Dr. Jiajie Zou](https://www.esi-frankfurt.de/people/jiajiezou/), and Wei Liu). It provides a psycholinguistic research tool based on artificial intelligence language models in natural language processing, which is convenient to extract language features and carry out language-related tasks.
